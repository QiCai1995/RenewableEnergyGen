# Renewable Energy Generation From 1960 to 2023

## Project Overview and Goals

The project aims to analyze the trends and patterns in renewable energy generation from 1960 to 2023. As the world faces increasing environmental challenges and a growing need for sustainable energy sources, understanding the evolution of renewable energy production becomes crucial. By examining data spanning over six decades, we seek to identify key milestones, shifts in technology, and the overall growth of renewable energy within this extensive timeframe.
As I am passionate about renewable energy and wanted to look into renewable energy generation since 1960s til now.
I analyzed top countries with the most generation and created various visualizations.
